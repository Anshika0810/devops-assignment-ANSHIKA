# WordPress Dockerization & Database Optimization"

The goal of this assignment is to Dockerize a WordPress application using best practices for Dockerfile and Docker Compose, as well as to optimize the database for improved performance. This README file documents the approach and provides additional notes related to the task.



## Task
## Task 1: Dockerizing WordPress

In this task, we'll Dockerize the WordPress application.

### Step 1: Create a Dockerfile

1. Create a Dockerfile with the following content:
   ```Dockerfile
   # Use an official WordPress image as the base image
   FROM wordpress:latest

   # Set appropriate labels
   LABEL maintainer="Anshika <abmr4747@gmail.com>"

   # Expose ports (HTTP and HTTPS)
   EXPOSE 80 443

   # Start the WordPress application
   CMD ["apache2-foreground"].

###  Step 2: Build the Docker Image
Build the Docker image:

    docker build -t my-wordpress-image .
### Step 3: Run a WordPress Container
Run a WordPress container:

    docker run -d --name my-wordpress-container -p 80:80 my-wordpress-image
### Step 4: Access WordPress
Access WordPress by opening a web browser and entering your EC2 instance's public IP address or DNS name in the address bar.
##
## Task 2: Docker Compose for WordPress
In this task, we'll use Docker Compose to orchestrate the WordPress application and a database.

### Step 1: Create a Docker Compose File
Create a Docker Compose file named "docker-compose.yml" in your working directory with the following content:

    version: '3'
    services:
    wordpress:
        image: wordpress:latest
        ports:
            - 8080:80
        environment:
            WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db
            WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpressuser
            WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpresspassword
        depends_on:
              - db
    db:
        image: mysql:5.7
        environment:
            MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword
            MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
            MYSQL_USER: wordpressuser
            MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpresspassword
    networks:
        wp-net

### Step 2: Start the Docker Compose Stack
Start the Docker Compose stack:

    docker-compose up -d
### Step 3: Access WordPress
Access WordPress by opening a web browser and entering your EC2 instance's public IP address or DNS name in the address bar.

## Task 3 Database Optimization
In this task, we'll optimize the database for improved performance.

### Step 1: Analyze Query Performance
Analyze query performance by enabling MySQL query logging.

Set slow query log:

    SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 'ON';
    SET GLOBAL long_query_time = 1;
View slow queries:

    sudo cat /var/log/mysql/mysql-slow.log
### Step 2: Optimize Slow Queries
Optimize slow queries by implementing indexing, query rewriting, and schema optimization.
### Step 3: Analyze Table Fragmentation
Analyze table fragmentation using:

    SELECT information_schema, 5
    FROM information_schema.tables
    WHERE table_schema = 'db';
### Step 4: Adjust Server Configuration
Adjust the MySQL server configuration in the my.cnf file based on your system's resources and workload.
### Step 5: Monitor Performance
Continuously monitor performance using tools like MySQL's Performance Schema.
### Step 6: Regular Backups
Always take backups before making significant database changes.
### Step 7: Testing
Test optimizations on a development or staging server before implementing them in production.
## Additional Notes and Recommendations
1. Keep the my.cnf file for documentation of MySQL server configuration changes.
2. Consider high availability solutions for production environments.

## Challenges
1. Ensure compatibility between Docker Compose and the database container.
2. Configure environment variables for WordPress and database connection securely.
